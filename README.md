# test-internet-connect
Windows Batch Script to monitor and test an internet connection

This was created to test a home internet connection that would go down for a few hours and come back. After several service calls and rounds of ineffective advice from the connection provider (no names), I wanted to get actual stats on when the connection was up and when it was down.

# instructions
This runs on Windows. It doesn't assume any version of Powershell, Perl, Python, Ruby, or anything else, other than the ping command working.

- Edit the settings in test-connect.bat as desired.
- Open a command prompt and naviagate to the location of test-connect.bat.
- Type test-connect

The program will run until you kill the window.

# licensing notes
I used the Unlicense for this, as this is largely cobbled together from 'how to' sites and blog posts.
